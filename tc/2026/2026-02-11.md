**Led by:** Amit Handa

## Attendance
* **Present:** Ilya Grigorik, Naga Malepati, Daniel Wyckoff, Amit Handa, Maxime Najim, Drew Olson, Aaron Glazer, Guillaume Verdier, Imran Hoosain

## 1. Review of Action Items from previous meeting
* [x] Implementation of GitHub team automation - *Status: Done*
* [x] Establish new communication channels - *Status: Done*

## 2. Technical Decisions & Consensus
* **Topic:** Migration to New Google Group
    * **Discussion:** A new Google Group was created to replace the restricted internal group, ensuring all TC members can access the interface. The council discussed balancing communication between the group (for deep, async reviews) and chat (for urgent matters).
    * **Decision:** Approved. The new group will be the primary mailing list; chat remains for time-sensitive coordination.
    * **Context:** New Google group for TC - https://groups.google.com/g/ucp-tech-council

* **Topic:** GitHub Governance Automation
    * **Discussion:** Updates were provided on the transition to a new team structure (Maintainers, DevOps Maintainers, Tech Council) to enforce governance rules through automation.
    * **Decision:** Approved. The transition phase is active; members must accept organization invites within 7 days.

* **Topic:** Color Scheme Parameter for Embedded Checkout
    * **Discussion:** Proposal to add `ec_color_scheme` (light/dark) to coordinate host and iframe themes. Debate occurred regarding an "auto" value, but consensus was reached that omitting the parameter correctly defaults to system-level behavior.
    * **Decision:** Approved via lazy consensus.
    * **Context:** [PR #157 feat: add ec_color_scheme query parameter to embedded checkouts](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/157)

* **Topic:** Standardization of Error Codes
    * **Discussion:** Formally defining well-known error codes within the schema to improve integrator consistency.
    * **Decision:** Approved via lazy consensus.
    * **Context:** [PR #147 feat: Add first-class errors concept](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/147)

* **Topic:** Authentication Requirements (Signatures vs. API Keys)
    * **Discussion:** Discussion on whether request signatures should be mandatory. It was agreed that while signatures are vital for scalable trust in open agent-to-agent contexts, negotiated API keys are a valid alternative for established partners.
    * **Decision:** API keys as an alternative to signatures is not controversial, but more discussion needed around the PR regarding security.
    * **Context:** [PR #156 feat: signing for UCP requests & responses](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/156)

* **Topic:** Tender-Based Discounts & Real-Time BIN Mapping
    * **Notes:** Concerns were raised regarding the security risks of sharing real-time BIN mappings with merchants during instrument selection. 
    * **Decision:** To avoid blocking implementations, the council agreed on an out-of-band solution for mapping data while a broader modeling discussion for loyalty and identity-based discounts continues.
    * **Context:** [PR #137 feat: Allow tender-based discounts via payment instrument qualifiers in Checkout Session Update](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/137)
 
* **Topic:** Deprecation of Checkout IDs
    * **Discussion:** The council reviewed the proposal to mark checkout IDs as `deprecated_required_to_omit`. There was a technical discussion regarding the impact on TypeScript schemas; it was noted that fields must be made optional for the deprecation to work correctly within the schema-authoring environment.
    * **Decision:** Approved in principle. Final resolution of schema dependencies is being handled asynchronously.
    * **Context:** [PR #145 fix!: Mark checkout id as deprecated_required_to_omit for update requests](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/145)

## 3. Open Discussions & TC PR Reviews

* **Topic:** Payments Roadmap Proposal
    * **Notes:** A multi-phase roadmap was presented to make complex payment features core to the protocol.
        * **Phase 1:** Standardizing Instrument Discovery (hoisting support definitions to top-level primitives) and Split Payments (enabling redeemables like gift cards).
        * **Phase 2:** Purchase Options (Subscriptions, Pre-orders). Debate occurred regarding modeling subscriptions as a separate capability vs. a purchase option within checkout; further modeling is required.
        * **Phase 3:** Payment Terms (Installments, B2B net-terms).

* **Topic:** Unified Incentives Protocol (UIP)
    * **Notes:** The council noted external efforts to create incentive extensions and discussed the need to establish thresholds for when widespread extensions should be incorporated into the core UCP protocol.
